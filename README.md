#I'm currently working on question 3 for homework 3. It ask me to classifiy different types of wine through clustering and principle
#components analysis (CPA). He haven't started the CPA chapter yet; Dr. Scott only briefly mentioned how it works.

#I'm stuck on this problem.

#1) I'm waiting until we start the chapter on CPA before I can really finish the proble.

#2) I'm not sure how to do the part on clustering. Essentially, for the data set we are using, we have 11 covariates that we use
#for the clustering algorithm, and two covariates (color and quality) that we leave out. However, we have to use clustering to predict
#color and quality. I'm not sure how or if we can do this. I emailed Andrew yesterday asking for guidance.
